Peer Programming with Chris Protocol:
Observer: Yordan Mitev

Chris managed to explain how his implementation works and showed me some use cases of each functionality he has, for example for the logging.
He also has a very good self-explainatory function names, although on some spots the logic is too complex.

Documentation and Implementation:
log.py has enough documentation and python rules are taken into account.
config has enough documentation and python rules are taken into account.
channel has enough documentation and python rules are taken into account.
sync.py has enough documentation and python rules are taken into account.
sync.py needs a use case example.

Problems:
In main.py -> use small functions for each task init, examples are setting up initital boundaries, set, tuner.
Implement endless loop in main.py as a function with small functions for part of the complex logic within, needed is also a clean up of dublicate code
